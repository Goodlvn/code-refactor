# code-refactor

In this [project](https://goodlvn.github.io/code-refactor/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener} we were given an website from a ficticious client. We are tasked with taking a look at the html structure and styling of the cleints website. We are asked to make it more accesible to comply with industry standards as well as re-organize the way the html is written so it is more semantically correct. The goal is to make all the changes without effecting the way the website displays. 

## Technolgies Used

1. HTML - used to create the elements of a website
2. CSS - used to style the contents of a website 

In my attempt to complete the assignment I tried to remove as many of the divs that I could and replacing them with more semantic tags like 

```<header></header>
<nav></nav>
<figure></figure>
<main></main>
<section></section>
<footer></footer>
```

The main reference that I used throughout the assignment was a resource that Jerome posted. It's about [semantic html page elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)


I interpreted the hw instructions as a work flow for myself that looked as follows: 

1. Make sure all html elements are semantic
2. Is the html grouped in a way that makes sense - would another developer be able to look at the code and easily form a mental picture of what is going on 
3. Do all of the images have an `alt=" "` attribute to them 
4. Do all of the header elements make chronological sense? - i was a bit unclear here
5. Does the tab sound fitting for out client and what they do
